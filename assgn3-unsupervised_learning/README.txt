The code for the experiments is in three Jupyter notebooks located in the code directory:
1. unsupervised_learning_1.ipynb: Clustering without dimensionality reduction (the clustering algorithms applied to two datasets, a total of 4 experiments)
2. unsupervised_learning_2.ipynb: Clustering with dimensionality reduction (PCA applied to the two datasets, followed by clustering, a total of 6 experiments)
3. unsupervised_learning_3.ipynb: Classification of one of the datasets used previously using a neural network after applying the three dimensionality reduction algorithms (a total of 3 experiments)
