### Directory structure:
code/: Jupyter notebooks and Python files
data/: Datasets as csv files

### Code dependencies:
Python3
scikit-learn
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
load_data.py in code/

### Instructions for running the code:
There are two Jupyter notebooks:
supervised_learning.ipynb for the Breast Cancer dataset
supervised_learning_2.ipynb for the Wine Quality dataset

Open them using
jupyter notebook <notebook-name>

Running all the cells will produce the graphs and print the results reported in the analysis.
The file load_data.py contains helper functions to load the datasets from csv files.
